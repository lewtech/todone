# Notes 

I am creating a Todo list as a take home exercise after an interview. I
don't have much practical experience in webdevelopment lately, so I am
starting mostly from scratch. I do have a fundamental understanding of
webdevelopment/js/css/bootstrap. I think php is my best bet. I can get
a functional app up quickly, demonstrating all of the above requirements. It
would be nice to really dive into webdevelopment and design something
that's responsive, functional, and beautiful. But that is a task for Future-Lew.
